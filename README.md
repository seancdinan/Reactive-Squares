# Reactive-Squares
## Goals:
* Create a 3 by 3 image grid.
* When you hover over one block, all the other blocks change to create a mosaic of a larger image
..* In a practical application, could be an effective way to use limited pagespace to convey a larger message with context
* Inspired by the portfolio layout at (Viens-LÃ )[http://www.viens-la.com/]
